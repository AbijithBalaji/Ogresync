Targeted subprocess.run fixer for setup_wizard.py

This script specifically targets subprocess.run calls in setup_wizard.py and replaces them
with the existing run_command_safe() function to hide console windows in packaged apps.

This is a safer, more targeted approach than the previous automated script.
