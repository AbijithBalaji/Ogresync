Focused test for the specific offline-to-online conflict resolution push bug.
This simulates exactly what the user described:
1. Work offline and make changes
2. Come back online 
3. Conflict resolution is triggered and user resolves it
4. Check if the resolved changes are immediately pushed to GitHub

This is a regression test for the bug where conflict resolution succeeds
but the resolved changes aren't pushed to GitHub.
